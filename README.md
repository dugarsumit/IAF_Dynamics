# IAF_Dynamics

Through this work, we propose the incorporation of Inverse Autoregressive Flows<sup>4</sup> in determining the state space (latents) in a dynamical system model. This reduces the number of samples that need to be obtained in order to approximate the posterior distribution (and thus the underlying states/latents for a set of observations and controls) from one per time step to one per sequence of observations. Our experiments with pendulum-v0<sup>1</sup>, an environment from openai gym confirmed that the accuracy with which the observations are generated are close to the state of the art for sequence models.

The results from this work, along with its benefits and issues are present in the following poster (PDF version [here](Documents/Inserted_IAF_poster.pdf))
